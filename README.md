# 📚 Database Systems Project — *Sabancı University (CS306)*

Welcome to the official repository for the **Database Systems Course Project** completed as part of **CS306** at *Sabancı University*.  
This multi-phase project showcases the full development cycle of a database application — from design to deployment — combining SQL, triggers, stored procedures, and a real-time web-based support system using Firebase.

---

## 📁 Project Phases

### 🔹 **Phase I: Data Modeling & SQL Foundations**
**Goal:**  
Design the foundation of a database application.

- ✔️ Created an **Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram**
- 🔁 Translated the ER model into a **Relational Model**
- 🛠️ Wrote **SQL scripts** with `CREATE TABLE` and `INSERT` statements

**Deliverable:**  
A comprehensive report with the ER diagram, relational schema, and SQL script documentation.

### 🔹 **Phase II: Backend Logic & Web Integration**
**Goal:**  
Enhance the database functionality with automation and user interaction.

- 🔄 Implemented a **Trigger** and a **Stored Procedure**
- 🌐 Developed a simple **Web Interface** for database interaction
- 📊 Enabled data entry and result display via the browser

**Deliverable:**  
SQL logic (trigger & procedure), HTML/CSS/JS web interface, and a feature showcase with screenshots.

### 🔹 **Phase III: Real-Time Support System with Firebase**
**Goal:**  
Build a full-stack, real-time messaging system for user support.

- 💬 Designed a **Support Page** where users submit issues
- 🧑‍💼 Created an **Admin Dashboard** with secure login and real-time response handling
- ☁️ Leveraged **Firebase Firestore** for backend and real-time data sync
